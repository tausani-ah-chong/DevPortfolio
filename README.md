## Story
This is our final Group Project that was presented during a 15 week Software Develeopment Bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy.

We wanted to create a platform for ALL developers to be able to showcase their work, their personalities and get connected to employers.

Our main focus was on the visual aspect. 

We wanted the focal point to be the portfolio or work itself first before the developer.
